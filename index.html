        <p>Hello, and welcome to "North of the Border". My name is Matthew Oakley. I'm British, married to Hyunsu Cha since 2004, and I have two lovely children, Samantha and Tiffany.
            I've lived in South Korea since graduating from the Bible College of Wales in 2002.</p>
        <p>I was born again in a tent crusade aged 12, and was filled with the Holy Spirit aged 16. After studying Classics at Cambridge University,
            I spent five wonderful years in Northern France, sharing the gospel, leading worship and preaching in a Baptist Church.
            I saw the wonderful supernatural work of the Holy Spirit and led several people to Christ. During that time, God gave me a dream
            in which I saw the Lord Jesus about to return to the earth (I did not see his face). I was overwhelmed by the impression of his power, authority and holiness.
            The dream had an enormous impression on me, and the return of the Lord has been a strong theme for me ever since.</p>
        <p>After returning to the UK in 1997, I attended the Bible College of Wales in Swansea, which was founded by the missionary Rees Howells.
            After that, I spent a year helping a mission group called 'Nations' in Llanelli. I was then invited to come to Korea by my good friend Wan-Jin Hong,
            who leads Chunbosan Prayer Mountain in NamYangJu, east of Seoul.</p>
        <p>In Korea, I have led English worship in several churches in Pusan, Incheon and most recently Osan Baptist Church.</p>
        <p>My entire purpose in Korea is to fulfill the mission of North of the Border, which God gave me in a dream in 2004.
            I met the Lord Jesus a second time in a dream in 2014, in which he told me that "For as long as you have lived in South Korea,
            you must live in North Korea to get to know the nation and its people. I can't say I'm thrilled at the prospect, to be honest,
            but I'm sure the work will be satisfying. The Lord said "My food is to do the work of Him who sent me".</p>
        <p>Regarding ministry credentials, I have no ordination from men, but I am a gift of Jesus Christ to the Church according to Ephesians 4:11. Grace is with me wherever I preach.</p>
